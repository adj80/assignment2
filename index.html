			<p>I have a sad tale (no pun intended). Once a momma dog to several puppies, my puppies were taken away from me and I was discarded on the streets of San Antonio.  With no where to go and no love in my heart, I thought my days were done... that was until I found my furever home.  Now, I am a happy, well-fed and most importatntly well-loved and cherished pet with a family to call my own.  My once sad tale is now a happy tale (pun intended).
			</p>

			<p>I recently moved to Austin with my momma. She is a proud bobcat from Texas State University- San Marcos (GO Bobcats!) as well as a roadrunner from UTSA (GO Roadrunners!)... so I guess you could call her a roadcat. I enjoy walking, visiting with family and friends and spending time at the lake.  I am what you call one lucky pup.
